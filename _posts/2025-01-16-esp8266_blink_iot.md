This script uses a Lolin NodeMCU v3 board with WIFI to make a unsecured http webpage with buttons to control an LED to test the ESP8266 wifi chip. This is based on an [Instructable 'Getting Started With ESP8266(LiLon NodeMCU V3) Complete Guide for IoT Startup With Example'](https://www.instructables.com/Getting-Started-With-ESP8266LiLon-NodeMCU-V3Flashi/) which was modified to include bug fixes.

## Requires

Hardware:

- ESP8266 chip with wifi (NodeMCU Lolin V3)
- LED
- Micro USB cable
- WIFI access

Software:

- [Ardruino IDE]
- [esp8266 by ESP8266 Community] board driver
- [curl]


## Procedure

We use the `Ardruino IDE` for code editing, compiling and flashing the board.

Refer to [esp8266 blinking post]({% post_url 2025-01-16-esp8266-blink %}) for info on how to install the NodeMCU ESP8266 driver in Ardruino.

### Select board

In top of window click `Select Board`. Select the `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)` board.

### Select port

In the same window, selected the port on my USB which is connected to the microUSB socket on the NodeMCU board
```
/dev/cu.usbserial-1130 Serial Port (USB)
```

### Circuit

Connect LED negative leg to GND and positive leg to D3 on the NodeMCU ESP8266 board.


### Code

```
INSERT CURRENT CODE HERE
```

### Verify code and upload to board

Click the tick icon to check code syntax. This correctly found the ESP8266 header file.
```
Using library ESP8266WiFi at version 1.0 in folder: /Users/u9904893/Library/Arduino15/packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/3.1.2/libraries/ESP8266WiFi
```

Click the Right arrow icon to upload code to board.

This shows the IP address is: `10.1.1.141`
```
09:19:44.853 -> Waiting for wifi connection...
09:19:45.346 -> Waiting for wifi connection...
09:19:45.839 -> Waiting for wifi connection...
09:19:46.332 -> Waiting for wifi connection...
09:19:46.827 -> Waiting for wifi connection...
09:19:47.356 -> Waiting for wifi connection...
09:19:47.356 ->
09:19:47.356 -> WiFi connected
09:19:47.356 -> IP address:
09:19:47.356 -> 10.1.1.141
09:19:47.356 -> Server started
09:19:47.356 -> Navigate to: http://10.1.1.141/
09:19:47.356 ->
09:19:58.768 -> new client
09:19:58.768 -> GET / HTTP/1.1
09:20:00.783 -> Client disonnected
```

### Demo

Navigating to http://10.1.1.141/ shows the initial LED state is OFF, and pressing either of the ON or OFF buttons on the webpage changes the LED and webpage to http://10.1.1.141/LED=ON or http://10.1.1.141/LED=OFF, accordingly.

Using `curl`, we can start a new client to download the text of each webpage, and send that command to the NodeMCU ESP8266:

http://10.1.1.141:
```
curl http://10.1.1.141


Led is : Off<br><br>
<a href="/LED=ON""><button>Turn On </button></a>
<a href="/LED=OFF""><button>Turn Off </button></a><br />
</html>
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
```

http://10.1.1.141/LED=ON:
```
curl http://10.1.1.141/LED=ON


Led is : On<br><br>
<a href="/LED=ON""><button>Turn On </button></a>
<a href="/LED=OFF""><button>Turn Off </button></a><br />
</html>
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
```

http://10.1.1.141/LED\=OFF:
```
curl http://10.1.1.141/LED\=OFF


Led is : Off<br><br>
<a href="/LED=ON""><button>Turn On </button></a>
<a href="/LED=OFF""><button>Turn Off </button></a><br />
</html>
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer
```

The LED can be controlled by any curl or webpage request to the 3 urls from a machine on our local area network. Successfully tested from Chrome browser on macOS laptop and mobile android phone, and with curl from MacOS.

Note, curl requires escaping of the "=" special character in urls.

Note, the ESP8266 usually disconnects from the LAN after several minutes, requiring a reboot of the board to reconnect.
