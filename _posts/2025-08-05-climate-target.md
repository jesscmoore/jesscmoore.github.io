A brief missive that I submitted to Federal Government in the [petition to set the strongest possible 2035 climate target](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/actions/petition-climate-targets-and-action/?apcid=0066ea6bf4156cf29a8d2401&utm_campaign=fun-bof-dc-emo-ta-lead-250&utm_content=fun-bof-dc-emo-ta-lead-250&utm_medium=email&utm_source=ortto) in answer to Prof Tim Flannery's callout to supporters (see the [Climate Council](https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/)).

> Every day that is a good day, I am nourished by Country when I take a brief time to get out for a ramble. I head up the trails any of several ways and with happy legs, 15 minutes later I'm on our local ridge.
>
> I look out at trees standing sentinel, see the horizon kiss the sky, and fellow mammals in their morning rituals. A quick nod amidst the healing breaths, and short while later I'm back peeling off falling apart runners and layers against the frost. Refreshed. Reassured that Country is still Country. Ready to get on with the day.
>
> Our land needs our care. It is doing its best to survive catastropic anthropogenic change. We must come together to collaborate, be ambitious in avoiding more disastrous environmental change. To protect our heritage and community, all the creatures in it.
