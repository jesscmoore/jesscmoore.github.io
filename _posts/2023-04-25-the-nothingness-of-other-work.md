This is a reflection on an article I read last weekend and the feelings or indeed understanding that it triggered. "Friday essay: ‘I trained to be an engineer … now I am a pickle seller’. What does migration do to a wife?" The researcher described she had designed her study and the survey expecting stories related to her research question, and in doing so was hearing stories about another sets of experiences that was remarkably common amongst them. They described how on leaving their homeland to come to Australian as a migrant they became increasingly isolated from their professional life. These women all had professional careers, but they were increasingly isolated and unable to connect to those professions. One lady descrihed it as "Instead of feeling joy and excitement, [it was] as if I was losing myself bit by bit into the unknown."

This resonated because as a astronomer learning to work outside of research, I was progressively losing connection with the ways of working I understood and my connections, those people who knew what I do and can do. Instead I was alone in a system designed for other people, and expected to do a very different type of work. Almost everything about the work environment was different. I found I was with people whose values, and desired outcomes were very different to my own. I had made the decision to leave my research area, thinking I was being pragmatic. Actually I had decided I could not work in research or applied science in a way that would be compatible with my personal needs. It only took a short while to uncover very interesting work. The most exciting times have been when skills, opportunity and diverse team have come together. Over time I have become better at assessing whether the ingredients are in place for this, and whether to experiment or not.

In times of big decisions, it is important to think about what motivates me and gives me intrinsic happiness. For me these are probably family, learning, and to be creating a better future. It's important to be in the work you want to do. And while its good to get the perspective of other facets of a large scale puzzle, its better to work to ones strengths.

Reflecting back on where I was then and the even more challenging position of the women in the article that inspired my thoughts, I realise how important it is for women to have networks that help them navigate through change. Through which they find people to get intel on the futures they're trying to decide between or plan for. 

As women we often make decisions for the benefit of our whole family, placing the wishes of the family first, and figuring we'll do what we need for ourselves later. However by working in our area of strength, we can attract and bring others into the team, and in these collaborations the strength of the team can be much greater, and we can focus on what we do best and/or work out of our comfort zone to realise the emerging opportunity.
