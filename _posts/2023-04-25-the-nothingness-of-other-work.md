This is a reflection on an article I read last weekend and the feelings or indeed understanding that it triggered. The researcher described she had designed her study and the survey expecting stories related to her research question, and in doing so was hearing stories about another sets of experiences that was remarkably common amongst them. They described how on leaving their homeland to come to Australian as a migrant they became increasingly isolated from their professional life. These women all had professional careers, but they were increasingly isolated and unable to connect to those professions.
- One lady descrihed it as

- "Friday essay: ‘I trained to be an engineer … now I am a pickle seller’. What does migration do to a wife?"

Instead of feeling joy and excitement, [it was] as if I was losing myself bit by bit into the unknown

This resonated because as a astronomy joining industry or governmne, I was progressively losing connection with the ways of weoking I Know, my connections, those people who knew what I do and can do, instead I was alone in a system not designed for me. I would be starting from scratch to establish my reputation in a different field.

As a PhD graduate in my first job, almost everything about the work environment was different. I found I was with people who values, and desired outcomes were very different to my own.

I had made the decision to leave my research area, thinking I was being pragmatic. Actually I was being scared of how to find a way to continue in research or applied R&D that would be compatible with my personal needs.

In these types of big decisions it is important to think about what motivates me and gives me intrinsic happiness. For me those are probably family, learning, and to be creating a better future.

By meeting and reaching out to others, we find those people with similar aspirations. Its important not to be in the work you want to do. And while its good to get the perspective of other facets of a large scale puzzle, its better to work to ones strengths.

Reflecting back on where I was then and the even more challenging position of the women in the article that inspired my thoughts, I realise how important it is for women to have networks that help them navigate through change. Through which they might get the contact of a contact who they might get in touch with to get some intel on the futurue they're trying to decide on or plan for. As women we often make decisions for the benefit of our whole family, placing the wishes of the family first, and figuring out we'll sort out a job or way to get back to our career after. However we must be careful that this doesn't take us away from our source of strengths and inspiration, and what makes one excited and speaks to who we are.
