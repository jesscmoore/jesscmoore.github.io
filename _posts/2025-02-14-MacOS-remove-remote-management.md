Removing remote management requires erasing the MacOS installation and unsetting the external Mobile Device Management profile (MDM) during a fresh installation. The computer is temporarily disconnected from the internet to prevent reinstall of the MDM profile.

Permission to boot from external disk is disabled by default in recent MacOS (since ~2020). To enable install from bootable USB, this setting must be enabled from recovery mode **before the operating system is deleted** (while the user exists with admin permissions).

## Procedure

### [Download MacOS]({% post_url 2025-02-14-download_macos_installer %})
