Here is a simple test on the Lolin NodeMCU v3 board to make an LED blink. We want get familiar with this board as it has the ESP8266 wifi chip.

## Requires

Hardware:

- ESP8266 chip with wifi (NodeMCU Lolin V3)
- LED
- Micro USB cable


## Procedure

We use the Ardruino IDE for code management and flashing the board.

### Install and select board for NodeMCU with ESP8266 board

1. As the esp8266 board is not already installed, we need to add the esp8266 board manager url to the list searched by Ardruino.

From Main menu > `Settings` > `Preferences` > `Settings` tab and add the esp8266 board url to the field:

```
Additional boards manager url: http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
```
and click `OK`.

2. Open `Board Manager` by clicking the board icon in LHS panel and in the search bar enter `esp8266`. Select `esp8266 by ESP8266 Community` and click `Install`

3. In top of window click `Select Board`. Select the `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)` board.

### Select port

In the same window, selected the port on my USB which is connected to the microUSB socket on the NodeMCU board
```
/dev/cu.usbserial-1130 Serial Port (USB)
```

### Code

```
#define LEDpin D4 //set pin of LED

// A setup function that runs once on reset press or board power up
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  // Initialise the pin labelled LEDpin as an output
  pinMode(LEDpin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(LEDpin, HIGH); // turn LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000); // wait 1s = 1000ms
  digitalWrite(LEDpin, LOW); // turn LED off by changing it to LOW voltage
  delay(1000);
}
```

### Verify code and upload to board

Click the tick icon to check code syntax.

Click the Right arrow icon to upload code to board.

This shows details of the chip, including MAC address, speed and storage size:
```
Serial port /dev/cu.usbserial-1130

```

### Demo

Connecting the positive end of the LED to D4 and the negative end to GND shows our code is successfully blinking the LED on and off for 1sec in each state.
